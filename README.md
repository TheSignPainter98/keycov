# KeyCov

Kitting is hard.
Making sure that your kitting makes sense requires three things:

1. Coverage of common keyboard types
2. Kits to be offered at a reasonable price and hence do not contain too many units
3. Kitting divisions to make sense to fellow humans

These constraints describe a fundamentally-human task containing a significant arduous part and which hence reduces its affinity with being solved by people.

In response, I wrote this script to give the keycap designer a hand by computing and summarising characteristics of their kitting in response to a set of keyboard layouts to cover.
Hopefully, this should make the task a little less painless, and lead to even better and more creative solutions expressly tailored to each set.
